This specification defines the 2nd edition of the 5th
major version, first minor revision of the core language
of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language
 (HTML).
 <img src="road.jpg" width="100%">
 In this version, a significant error with
 HTML 5.1 has been rectified, as noted in the Errata
 corrected section. Meanwhile, new features continue
 to be introduced to help Web application authors,
 new elements continue to be introduced based on
 research into prevailing authoring practices,
 and special attention continues to be given to
 defining clear conformance criteria for user
 agents in an effort to improve interoperability
 in the development of HTML 5.2.
